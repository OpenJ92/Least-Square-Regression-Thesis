# Least-Square-Regression-Thesis

###Goal:
I sought to demonstrate the motivation, construction and application of Linear Least Square Regression.

###Motivation:
see: sections - Mapping: Point to Point, Mapping: Point to Function

The sections _Mapping: Point to Point_ and _Mapping: Point to Function_ were constructed to familiarize the reader with the move from considering functions x -f(parameters, form)-> y as simply belonging to the plane A(x,y) to belonging to the collection A(x,y) X B(parameters). We demonstrate the form of coefficents belonging to B(parameters) which when mapped to A(x,y) always contain the points Q = {(x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2)} in plane A(x,y). We show that. Considering all forms in B(parameters) containing Combinations_Choose_2(Q) we show by example that those forms intersect in plane B(parameters). We then demonstrate that Combinations_Choose_3(Q), there exist forms which do not simulteneously intersect showing that there exists no such form which describes all three points. This then begs the question, does there exist a form in B(parameters) that reasonabally represents the points Q belong to A(x,y)?
